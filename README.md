# [Plantiet](https://jedzoka.github.io/plantiet) - Plan/t diet
**You can easily remix this project on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/plantiet)**<br><br>
There are many nutrition apps like eatthismuch or cronometer but this one is special - it is planning rather than tracking.
This is beneficial becouse the app can calculate nutritions on larger scope than a day, and you don't have to constantly use it.<br><br>
The app is heavly dependent on [FDC API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html) and it assumes that all given foods are in 
100 grams of serving size and particular nutrient always has relevant unit name. Message me if particular food is wrongly represented!
