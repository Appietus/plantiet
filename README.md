# [Plantiet](https://jedzoka.github.io/plantiet) - Plan/t diet
## The app consists of few elements:<br>
**-counter on right** is for setting days of your diet(before clicking select). By clicking on the number itself you make operations more precise. You can set this counter to 0 to enter references mode<br>
**-select** is for selecting your age group<br>
**-type your food name here** is for adding foods' data to cache. You type something like "banana" -> you click on particular record and this adds it to the cache<br>
**-load items** is for loading items from cache -> the items will appear -> you click on items to add them to your diet. Try to make all of table's numbers positive<br>
**-delete items** is for deleting items from cache. The item value must be other than 0 and counter on right needs to be set to 0. Otherwise the operation won't be executed<br>
**-link** is for sharing your configuration with others<br>
**-output** shows quantity of items you've selected<br>
**-copy** is for copying text from textarea<br><br>
